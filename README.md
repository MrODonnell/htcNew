# Commands for use on the command line for git

## one time only use at the beginning

* git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
* git config --global user.name 'myemail@mail.com'

## on an ongoing basis, probably several times a day

* git add filename.txt
* git commit -m 'short description of changes'

## weekly perhaps?  or maybe once a day

* git init <repoName>
* git push

# use one \# to create a top-level header

# use two \# \# for the next down header

###### I think six is the smallest header

* an astrisk will display as a list item
	* indented will show as a sub list
	* another list item

** not sure what, if anything two \* \* will do

# Using VI

When you first open a file using VI you will be in command mode.
You can switch to interactive more using "i" for insert, or "a" for 
append.  If you want to go back to command mode, which you need to
do to exit, use the esc key.  

## commands

* ZZ will save your file
* a will put you into an interactive mode so you can write or modify text
